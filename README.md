# unpaywall
Chrome extension that gives you a link to a free PDF when you view scholarly articles. 
Uses the [oaDOI](https://oadoi.org) API.

This version is customized for Caltech and will redirect non-OA content to Caltech Library

## Install
To install this modified version download all the code on GitHub to some location on your computer.  In Chrome go to chrome://extensions/, disable Unpaywall if it’s installed, and check the “Developer mode” box in the upper right corner of the screen.  Then click “Load unpacked extension” and find the unpaywall directory you just downloaded.  Click on the “extension” directory and click select.  The “CaltechMOD” version of Unpaywall should then show up (A manifest warning might appear; it doesn't seem to be a problem).
