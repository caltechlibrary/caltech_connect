                Upload a list of DOIs, and we'll access the Unpaywall database to find OA information for each one. You'll get results as a spreadsheet emailed to you in a few minutes. You can check up to 10,000 DOIs at a time this way.

            <h2>Success!</h2>
            <p>
                Your DOIs have been submitted. In a few minutes, you'll get an email
                from us with an attached spreadsheet showing the results. Keep an eye on your spam folder, since automated emails can often be flagged as spam.

                Looks like we're having trouble processing your request. There may have been a problem with either the DOIs or the email you entered. Please email us at
                <a href="mailto:team@impactstory.org">team@impactstory.org</a> and we'll work to get the problem fixed.
