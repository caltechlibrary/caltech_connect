            Commercial use of Unpaywall data
        </h1>





    <p>
        The Unpaywall <a href="dataset">dataset</a> is free for noncommercial use. However, for commercial use you'll need to sign up for the Service-Level Agreement (SLA). This lets you:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Use the downloaded <a href="dataset">dataset</a> for
            commercial purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Get weekly updates on what changed in the Unpaywall database. So, if you start
            with the download file, then subscribe to the weekly updates, you'll be able to
            maintain an exact copy of the Unpaywall database, on your own local servers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Get enterprise-level service and support established and guaranteed in writing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Help support Unpaywall and keep it sustainable over the long term.
        </li>
    </ul>

        Of course, if you don't need  these features,
        you can always just use the
        <a href="api">API;</a> it's free to everyone for
        any use.
