            You can download the entire dataset behind Unpaywall; it's free for noncommercial use. It's pretty unwieldy at 100M rows, so unless you legit need the whole thing for your use case, you'll probably be better served by one of the
            <a href="data#use">lightweight alternatives.</a>
        </p>

            If you want to use the dataset for commercial purposes, check out our
